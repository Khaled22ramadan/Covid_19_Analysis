# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis
This project is a part of my internship at NTI, where I analyzed COVID-19 data worldwide using Python. The dataset includes details on cases, deaths, and regional trends, allowing for an insightful exploration of the pandemic’s impact.

# 📊 Key Insights

Missing Data Analysis – Columns like continent and location have missing values, requiring careful handling.

Global Case Averages – The mean number of new cases per day provides insights into the pandemic's evolution.

Death Rate Trends – Tracking the average number of new deaths per day helps assess severity.

Per Million Analysis – Normalized values per million inhabitants provide better comparability across regions.

Statistical Overview – Summary statistics highlight variations in COVID-19 impact worldwide.

# 🛠 Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Data Profiling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# 📌 Project Overview

This analysis includes:

Data cleaning and handling missing values.

Descriptive statistics and visualization.

Key trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

Region-wise comparisons.

# 🎓 Acknowledgment

I would like to express my gratitude to my instructor at NTI for their mentorship and support throughout this project.
